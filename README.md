# Thesis in Economics

This repository contains the work for our thesis in Economics, conducted in collaboration with Klara Holmer and Andres Cruz (me). In this project, we import, modify, and analyze publicly available data from Skolverket using R and Python. The project covers:

• Data Importing and Cleaning: Efficiently retrieving and preparing data for comprehensive analysis.
• Data Transformation: Modifying and structuring data to enhance its analytical utility.
• Data Analysis: Employing robust analytical techniques with R and Python to derive meaningful insights.

Please note that this is an ongoing academic project. The repository structure and codebase will evolve as new insights are incorporated and methodologies are refined.
