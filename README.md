# Thesis in Economics

This repository contains the work for our thesis in Economics, conducted in collaboration with Klara Holmer and Andres Cruz (me). In this project, we import, modify, and analyze publicly available data from Skolverket using Python and R. The project covers:

	•	Data Importing and Cleaning: Retrieving and preparing data for analysis.
	•	Data Transformation: Modifying and structuring data.
	•	Data Analysis: Employing analytical techniques with R to derive meaningful insights.

Please note that this is an ongoing academic project. The repository structure and codebase will change.
